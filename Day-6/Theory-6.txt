1) what is microservice?
Ans: microservice are an architectural and organization approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services
that communicate over well-defined APIS.These are owned by small,self-contained teams. microservice architecturs make applications easier to scale
and faster to develop,enabiling innovation and accelrating time-market for new features.

2) What is Monolith architecture?
Ans:with monolith architecture , all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service.This means that if one process of application is
spike in demand entire architecture must be scaled.Adding or implimenting monolith application features becomes more complex as the code base grows.

3).What is difference between microservice and Monolith ?
Ans: with monolith architecture , all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service.This means that if one process of application is
spike in demand entire architecture must be scaled.Adding or implimenting monolith application features becomes more complex as the code base grows.
This complexity limits experimentation and make it difficult to implement new ideas.Monolith architecture add risk for application availbility
because many tightly coupled  process increase the impact of a single process failure.

With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. 
These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for business capabilities and
each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and 
scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.
