1)What is JSX ?
Ans: It is a funny Tag syntax which is neither a string nor HTML.It is syntax extension for javascript.JSX may remind you of a template language,
but it comes with full power of javascript.

2)What are super powers of JSX?
Ans: Jsx represent objects. Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.React.createElement()
performs few checks and to help you write bug free code but essentially it creates an object like this.

// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};

These objects are called react elements.

3)Role of type attribute in script tag ? What options can i use there ?
Ans: The type attribute specifies the type of the script and identifies the content between <script></script> tags.
We can use type="module" or type="importmap".

4){TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in jsx
Ans: {TitleComponent} it doesn't treat as component but as a stirng.
{<TitleComponent/>} it calls the component.
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} this is another way of calling component but when nested components are present.
